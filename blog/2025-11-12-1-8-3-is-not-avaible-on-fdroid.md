<!-- truncate -->

## The root cause

Recently, FDroid's had some difficulty with the build process. For details, please checkout their 
issue [#593](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/admin/-/issues/593).

TL;DR: An update to Android Gradle Plugin (APG) caused aapt2 fail to run. 

## What's next?

> Nothing

Everything's normal now. All you have to do is to wait until the pickup Kreate
to build and to distribute latest version.
