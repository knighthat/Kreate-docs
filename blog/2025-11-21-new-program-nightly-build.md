At 8:29AM every day, an automatic script will check for any changes to the code and build a `prerelease` version.

<!-- truncate -->

If you like trying new things and don't care about unstability, then you can participate in this program. 
It'll also help us locate bugs earlier because having multiple test inputs is always better.

This version is completely separated from the release channel, **you can install both at the same time**. 
However, cached/downloaded songs can not be used interchangeably.

To participate, download a copy of `Kreate-nightly.apk` on [releases page](https://github.com/knighthat/Kreate/releases/tag/v2025.11.21).

This version comes bundled with auto-update, so you don't have to manually check for update everyday.

:::tip
Enable auto-update in **Settings** > **Update checker** > **Automatically download & install when new version becomes available.**
