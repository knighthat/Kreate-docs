import { IonIcon } from '@ionic/react';
import { logoAndroid } from 'ionicons/icons';

This tutorial will walk you through steps to add your assets to Kreate project.

:::tip
For best results, please consider using [<IonIcon icon={logoAndroid} /> Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
To setup Kreate in Android Studio, please refer to [Getting Started](/dev/getting_started).
:::

The very first step is to make sure we're working on the correct folder. In this tutorial, we're only
going to use `res` folder in `androidMain`. Here's the path:

```
composeApp/src/androidMain/res
```

![androidMain res location](./img/androidMain-res-location.webp)

:::info
Kreate is categorized as a multiple platform project. Meaning, `res` in `androidMain`,
`commonMain`, `desktopMain` are valid paths.

Each serves different platform, except for `commonMain`, which is universal. 
But for simplicity, this tutorial will not going to use it.

## 📍 Get SVG location

> You must satisfy all requirements in [Prerequisite](#prerequisite) section in order to move on.

There are several ways you can copy a file's path. Some OS has this buton right in the menu.

![Copy path from menu](./img/copy-path-from-menu.webp)

If you don't see this option, you can use the address bar (typically located at the top of your file manager)

![File manager address bar](./img/file-manager-address-bar.webp)

To copy from here, you need to select it, then highlight everything to copy.

![Copy path from address bar](./img/copy-path-from-address-bar.webp)

:::info
[KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/) is used in this tutorial, 
but [File Explorer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Explorer) and [Finder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finder_(software))
should have similar approach

## ✎ᝰ Converting SVG to XML

> Why? You may ask. 

The answer is simple, Android doesn't support SVG, at least, not all of the features SVG provides.

XML file (internally called [VectorDrawable](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/graphics/vector-drawable-resources)) 
as the name implied, is in fact, a Vector, but with limited functionalities compared to SVG

Luckily, you don't have to convert your SVG to XML prior to the import, Android Studio does this right before importing SVG file/

To import, follow these steps:

1. Right-click `res`
2. New
3. Vector asset

![New vector asset](./img/new-vector-asset.webp)

4. Configure your vector

After clicking **Vector asset**, you'll be greeted by this dialog - Configure vector asset

![Configure vector asset](./img/configure-vector-asset.webp)

Here, you'll need to add a few things:

- **Asset type**: what are you importing - `Local file` in this case
- **Name**: name of this asset, and name to be used in the development
  > Name must not contain any spaces, replace them with underscore ( _ )
- **Path**: path to your SVG file
- **Size**: the size of this vector **after** the conversion, should be 24 x 24 in most cases.
- **Opacity**: see-through level
- **Enable auto mirroring for RTL layout**: Check if your vector must be mirrored (flipped horizontally) when RTL is applied (usually for texts, or arrows)

5. Next
6. Verify everything
  > This confirmation dialog lets you make sure everything is in its correct place.

7. Finish

## 📋 Confirm asset & commit

At this point, you should be able to see your newly added asset in [Resource Manager](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/resource-manager).

The last step is to commit your changes and push it to your fork, and open a pull request.
