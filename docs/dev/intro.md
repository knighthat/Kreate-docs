Greetings!\
This page is dedicated to help new developers as well as people who already contributed to this project.

## What can I expect from this page?

Documents. Lots of them. We intend to log as many things as possible so new comers don't have
to figure things out _one by one_ (like we did).

## I'm new here

No worries. Let's get you up and running by getting you through installtion process.

Head over to [Getting Started](/dev/getting_started) to get yourself a copy of the repository.

## Basic navigation

headers (sections) of each page

## I want to contribute to this site

Scroll down to the bottom of this page and click "Edit this page" to get to the source code.
