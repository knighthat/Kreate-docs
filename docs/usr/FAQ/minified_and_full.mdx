## 📏 Short answer

There's **NO DIFFERENCE** between `full` and `minified` versions of the app.

The only difference is their sizes.


## ⚙️ How is it made?

As you may know, compiler takes current state of the code and translates it 
into something a machine can understand.

`full` version is the direct translation of the source code to APK with little
to no change.

```

`minified` version has an extra step executed during compilation. This step removes
all unused code, resources before finalizing the APK. Thus, making size of `minified`
smaller than `full`.

```

## ❓ Why `full` version exists?

Nothing is perfect, sometimes `minified` can cause trouble during installation.
Therefore, `full` version is still included in release post to help those having
problems continue to use app.
