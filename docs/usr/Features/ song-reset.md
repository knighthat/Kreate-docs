### All

Short-hand checkbox that selects everything else for you.

When you uncheck 1 of the above boxes, this box will uncheck itself automatically.

Toggling checkboxes doesn't actually apply the action, this is intended for fool-proof reason.

Hitting `Cancel` or pressing outside the dialog will close the dialog without doing anything else.

Hitting `Confirm` will  enact all selected actions above. If none selected, it'll just close the dialog
